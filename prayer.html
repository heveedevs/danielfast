<p><b>Daniel 10:2-3.</b> <i><b>2.</b>At that time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks. <b>3.</b> I ate no choice food; no meat or wine touched my lips; and I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.</i>
</p>	
	<p>In the old testament there are two passages that describe the fasts of Daniel. Combining those two brief descriptions, the Daniel Fast is now commonly used to refere to a fast that only includes vegetables and fruits to eat and water to drink. Dairy, meats, breads, and processed foods are avoided completely.</p>
		
<p> Prayer will see you through this time. God has done so much from you. He has brought you so far. A 21 day fast will be nothing compared to all the blessings you will receive.
